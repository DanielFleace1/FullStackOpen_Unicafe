The challenge is to create a react front end that receives customer feedback and displays statistics accordingly. The App will restart with a refresh of the page. 

Short overview of Steps:
-1.6: Create React app with 3 options for feedback for good, neutral, and bad and display totals for each. Application only needs to work during a single browser section. 
-1.7: Expand application to show an average score (good: 1, neutral: 0, bad: -1) and the percentage of positive feedback.
-1.8: Refractor statistics into its own statistics component leaving the state of the application in App root component. 
-1.9: Change application to display statistics only once feedback has been gathered.
-1.10: Extract a component for Button & StatisticLine. StatisticLine should deploy a single statistic.
-1.11: Display in an HTML table. The final product should look the file: FSO_uniCafe_FinalResult_ScreenShot.png. This is a screen shot for the FullStackOpen Website.
